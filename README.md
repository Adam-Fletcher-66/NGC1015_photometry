# NGC1015_photometry
Reduce science images collected of the galaxy NGC 1015 through photometry and then use bagpipes software to output stellar formation rate (SFR).

Upload your reduced science images through astrometry.net to plot coordinate positions in decimal form for each source in your images. Then use SExtractor to obtain the flux counts in electrons/pixel for all sources in your images. This project will then be able to extract the proper galactic source and input the information into bagpipes.
